# Core-Java-Assignment-2


This assignment is based on core java concept.
In this I created a Parent class 'Currency'. 

-Created  Rupee, Dollar and Euro as the subclasses. Made conversion method as a base method in Currency class. 
-Override this conversion method in all the other classes (Rupee, Dollar & Euro).
-Made a parameterized constructor in individual derived subclasses which takes amount, as parameters and does the required conversion.
-Made another class “calculateCurrency” with overloaded parameterized constructors. These parameterized constructors take convertFrom, convertTo and Amount and calculates the currency.       

use of Access Specifiers in the above program:
-Make the conversion method private in the parent class.
-Make the overridden methods public in the subclasses.
